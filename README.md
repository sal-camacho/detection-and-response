# Detection and Response Portfolio

This repository contains incident analysis walkthroughs, packet capture exercises, and threat detection reports completed as part of Google Cybersecurity Certificate. Each file documents key investigation techniques and demonstrates how to detect, analyze, and respond to suspicious activity using open-source tools and structured reporting.

Reports include packet inspection, rule-based alerting, log analysis, and protocol research—all aligned with best practices for cybersecurity readiness and incident response.

## About This Repository

As a Security Analyst in training, I’ve applied foundational detection and response skills to simulate real-world investigations and security operations. These walkthroughs demonstrate how I capture network traffic, analyze logs, and document findings using markdown and evidence-based techniques.

My work aligns with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and documents activity across its five domains: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

This repo features:

- Packet capture and inspection using Wireshark  
- Suricata rule creation and alert validation  
- Log analysis and event correlation  
- Protocol research and threat modeling
