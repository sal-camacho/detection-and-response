# Activity Overview

In this activity, you'll focus on the two network protocol analyzers: Wireshark and tcpdump. Your goal is to gain a basic understanding of the Wireshark and tcpdump, how they work, and what their features are.

As you've learned, a network protocol analyzer (packet sniffer) is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network. Network protocol analyzers help security analysts examine and understand the network traffic flows.

## Scenario

In your role as a cybersecurity analyst, you have been asked to research the differences and similarities between Wireshark and tcpdump and create a chart that outlines your findings.

## Network Protocol Analyzer Comparison — Wireshark vs. tcpdump

This report was completed as part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. It documents the core features of Wireshark and tcpdump, compares their functionality, and highlights how each tool supports packet analysis in different environments.

## My Contributions
- Researched official documentation for Wireshark and tcpdump to identify key features and limitations
- Compared GUI-based and CLI-based workflows for packet capture and inspection
- Documented similarities between both tools, including their ability to save and filter packet data
- Created a side-by-side comparison table to highlight differences in interface, filtering, protocol support, and use cases

## Tools Used
- Wireshark User Guide (Section 1.1.2, 1.1.6, 3.3, 8.4–8.8) — for GUI features, protocol dissection, and visualization tools
- tcpdump Tutorials and Man Pages — for command-line usage, filtering syntax, and performance considerations

## Reflections
- Wireshark’s GUI made it easier to visualize packet flow and dissect protocols in depth.
- tcpdump’s lightweight CLI interface is ideal for quick captures and remote diagnostics.
- Understanding the differences in filtering capabilities helped clarify when to use each tool.
- Comparing both tools reinforced the importance of choosing the right analyzer based on environment and task.
- This research activity improved my ability to evaluate cybersecurity tools and communicate their strengths clearly.
